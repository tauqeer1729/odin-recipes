    <h1>Haleem</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 

Haleem is a slow-cooked, savory dish popular in South Asia and the 
Middle East, especially during Ramadan. Itâ€™s made with a blend of
 wheat, lentils, and meat (usually mutton or chicken), cooked 
 together for hours until it becomes a thick, rich paste. Spiced 
 generously with garam masala, ginger, garlic, and fried onions,
  haleem is garnished with lemon juice, fresh coriander, green 
  chilies, and fried onions. Its creamy texture and deep flavor
   make it a hearty and filling meal. </p>
