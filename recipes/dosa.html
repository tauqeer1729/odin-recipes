    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dosa is a thin, savory crepe originating from South India, traditionally made from a fermented batter of ground rice and black gram (urad dal).
 It is a staple food in the region and is known for its crispy yet soft texture, often served hot with chutney and sambar.
 The fermentation process enhances its nutritional profile, increasing the bioavailability of B vitamins and probiotics, and makes it naturally gluten-free and low in fat.
 Dosa can be enjoyed plain (sada dosa) or stuffed with various fillings like spiced potatoes, vegetables,
  or cheese, and is typically eaten with the hands</p>
